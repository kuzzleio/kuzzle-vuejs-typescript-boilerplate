# Kuzzle, VueJS, TypeScript and CoreUI-Bootstrap boilerplate

A pretty fat boilerplate to start-off webapp projects based on Kuzzle and VueJS.
This boilerplate is composed of a **backend**, located in `./backend` and a **frontend**, located in `./frontend`.

Each layer of the stack contains its corresponding `README.md` file. Please refer to it.

## Overview

This boilerplate provides you with

  - A dockerized instance of Kuzzle, ready to be extended with a...
  - ...plugin boilerplate mounted as a volume in the Kuzzle Docker container.
  - A VueJS web application based on the Kuzzle SDK v6, including:
  - an implementation of the authentication method integrated with Vuex,
  - an implementation of the "Offline mode", also integrated with Vuex,
  - a complete i18n setup based on vue-i18n,
  - a complete CoreUI and Bootstrap-Vue installation (with Fontawesome 4),
  - an instance of the vue-izitoast plugin
  - a ready-to-go Cypress.io installation for e2e testing

## Install

Clone this repository using the following command

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-vuejs-coreui-boilerplate.git
```

> Note that the `--recurse-submodules` is important since the `backend` folder is a submodule pointing to the [Kuzzle Plugin
> Advanced Boilerplate](ttps://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-advanced-boilerplate).

Then, delete the Git tree and reinitialize the repo from scratch

```bash
cd kuzzle-vuejs-coreui-boilerplate
rm -rf .git
```

At this point you may rename the folder of your project to a meaningful name.
Then, you can set remote(s) the usual way

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <another-git-server-URL-here>
```

## And then what?

Start your local Kuzzle instance by typing

```bash
docker-compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Serve your web app locally by typing

```bash
cd frontend
npm install && npm run serve
```

Take a look at the `README.md` files in the `backend` and `frontend` directories to do the next steps.
